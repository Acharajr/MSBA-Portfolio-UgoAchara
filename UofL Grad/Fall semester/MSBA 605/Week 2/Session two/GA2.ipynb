    "### Problem 1 (2 points)\n",
    "In the code cell below, write a Python script that inputs an integer dollar amount (from 1 - 99 for this application) to be withdrawn from our virtual ATM. You may assume that the user follows your directions for the input (namely, entering an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive). Calculate and print the number of bills of each denomination (twenties, tens, fives, and ones) that should be dispensed, minimizing the total number of bills used. Start with twenties and work your way down to ones. If no bills of a particular denomination are needed, skip that bill in the output using `if` statements. (10 pts.)\n",
    "### Sample Output\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "Welcome to the Virtual ATM!\n",
    "Enter integer dollar amount (1 - 99): 94\n",
    "    \n",
    "Dispense:\n",
    "4 twenties\n",
    "1 tens\n",
    "4 ones\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: No _fives_ are printed in the above example because the entered dollar amount didn't require any. Your code, however, must include logic for every denomination (twenties, tens, fives, and ones). An easy way to approach this problem is with the use of floor division (`//`) and remainder (`%`) operations. In this example, the number of twenties needed is `94 // 20`, which gives 4. The remaining amount to be dispensed then is `94 % 20`, which is 14. The number of tens needed then is `14 // 10`, which gives 1. The remaining amount to be dispensed then is `14 % 10`, which is 4. The number of fives needed then is `4 // 5`, which gives 0 (so skip the output). The remaining amount to be dispensed then is `4 % 5`, which is still 4  but we know that should be dispensed as ones (since it's the lowest denomination left)."
