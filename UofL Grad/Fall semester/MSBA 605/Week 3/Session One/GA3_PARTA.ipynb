Using Boolean indexing (as shown in [Section 4.1](https://wesmckinney.com/book/numpy-basics#ndarray_boolean)), select all rows from `grades` where `students` is either `'Janet'` or `'Leann'`. Remember, to combine multiple Boolean conditions, use Boolean arithmetic operators like `&` (and) and `|` (or). Print both arrays and the result from `grades` after indexing. "
