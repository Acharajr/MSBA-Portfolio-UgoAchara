# **Track 1: Where Does the Data Come From?**

### **1. What is the source of the data?**  
The data comes from the organization, system, or study that originally recorded it. For instance, health data in the US can come from the CDC, NIH, CMS and HHS which were all places that the previous case competition pulled data from.

### **2. Who collected the data?**  
It was collected by the institution, researchers, or analysts responsible for the dataset. In other words, people who work within said organizations and institution.

### **3. When was the data collected?**  
It was collected during the specific time period defined by the study or operational process. This is usually contained in the metadata.

### **4. How was the data collected?**  
Through the method used by the source — such as surveys, sensors, transactions, logs, or manual entry.

### **5. What was the purpose of the data collection?**  
To support analysis, reporting, decision‑making, or research related to the topic. It could also be for record keeping.

### **6. Is the data source reliable? Why or why not?**  
It is reliable if it comes from a reputable source with consistent methods and clear documentation; less reliable if the source is unclear, biased, or lacks transparency.
